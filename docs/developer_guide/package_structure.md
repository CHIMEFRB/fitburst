## Package Structure
The `fitburst` codebase is organized into five distinct sub-directories that contain different types of algorithms and structures:

- `analysis/`: functions and objects relevant to the modeling of radio dynamic spectra;
- `backend/`: configuration data and project-specific I/O structures;
- `pipelines/`: executables that use the `fitburst` API;
- `routines/`: basic functions that define physical features of radio spectra;
- `utilities/`: functions and objects used for pre-processing of data;
