## Unit Conventions
We use the following unit conventions when declaring variables, arrays and/or matricies to be used by `fitburst`:

- the DM is in units of pc cm$^{-3}$;
- all measures and axes of time are in units of seconds;
- all measures and axes of electromagnetic frequency are in units of MHz.
