fitburst
========

This repository contains functions, objects, and scripts for modeling dynamic spectra of dispersed astrophysical signals at radio frequencies.

## Installation

Currently, `fitburst` can be installed by cloning the repo and running `pip` in the following way:

```
pc> git clone git@github.com:CHIMEFRB/fitburst.git
pc> cd fitburst
pc/fitburst> pip install . # add the --user option if you're looking to install in your local environment.
```

## Usage and Documentation
Please refer to the documentation linked above to find desciptions on the codebase and examples for interacting with it. 

## Publication
The theory behind the modeling and analysis routines is presented in a paper currently under review, but available on the arXiv. This paper includes a variety of fitting examples and discussions on the treatment of biasing effects (e.g., intra-channel smearing from pulse dispersion) that can be accounted for within `fitburst`. If you use this codebase and publish results obtained with it, we ask that you cite the `fitburst` paper using the following BibTex citation:

... COMING SOON! :sweat-smile

## Credits
All authors of the `fitburst` papers are the founding developers of `fitburst`, with Emmanuel Fonseca leading the development team. We welcome novel and meaningful contributions from interested users!
